# Introduction

We are going to start from the example of [Cynthia Huang

](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/) to see the basic framework.  She is building of the great work of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/).  We would like to formalize a more robust resume tool.  The `Design Objectives` section has some of our goals.

## First steps

Use this repo as a template to get your base resume into the format.

# Design Objectives

- Have resume templates
- store resume information in tables for each section
- provide pythonic version for put and get data of the tables 
- build python app for the resume creation
- provide docker version for building resume
- Document local install or docker install
- build streamlit app to allow users to enter information into the tables
- provide autobuild method using Github actions
- provide AI text editing for bullets and description in the streamlit app
